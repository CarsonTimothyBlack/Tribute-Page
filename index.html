    <h2 id="1">Pearl's story</h2>
    <p>Pearl was born on May 11, 2017, via c-section. She was a 1 on the first minute...hospital measurement stuff, which basically means she was in deep trouble that first minute. Very blue. Very not breathing. Very scary. However, she was a 5, the highest, by minute 5 of HMS (hospital measurement stuff), which means all was well. She passed all the regular tests:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>She cried</li>
        <li>She started turning from blue to pink</li>
        <li>She allowed a suction tube to pull liquid from her lungs</li>
        <li>She reacted to the "fall and catch", which is basically like a team building trust fall.

    </ul><hr />
   <h2 id="2">Pearl's pre-history</h2>
   <p>Pearl's parents met a little while before she was born. Probably about 4 years, give or take. Historians debate the precise timeline of this meeting, but most agree that it was love, or at the very least, interest at first sight.</p>
          <p>Once both parents realized that they were "interested" in eachother. They began cuddling.</p>
          <p>Like this:

            </figure>
    </p>
            <p>Anyway, regardless of what historians believe, debate, or have written doctoral theses on, the parents of Pearl eventually married.</p>
    <p>Like this:</p>

    <h2 id="3">Why Pearl's mother married Pearl's father</h2>
    <p>There is some debate as to why Pearl's mother, June, decided to marry Pearl's father, Carson.
    </p>
    <p>It's true that he can somtimes be suave:</p>
      <figure>
    <img style="border: 9px double #E74C3C" title="This is actually the only time Carson ever dressed up." src="https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/37673_415048053644_4697663_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-1.fna&oh=c3b20d8feac51d2b5c3ed4924877f6f0&oe=5CB289D6" alt="Suave Carson" height="200" width="200" /><br />
        <figcaption style="color:#2C3E50  "><b><i>Please hover over the image for more info.</i></b></figcaption>
      </figure>
    <p>However, most of the time he acts like this:</p>
      <figure>
    <img style="border: 9px double #E74C3C" title="The name on that balloon hat isn't even Carson's name. What a weirdo." src="https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/197197_4536258644_1538_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-1.fna&oh=7d10c3257128c387b1f1f18b12b94b22&oe=5CF1A0A5" alt="Not Suave" height="200" width="250"<br />
        <figcaption style="color:#2C3E50  "><b><i>Please hover over the image for more info.</i></b></figcaption>
      </figure>
    <p>Below is a table that scientists have put together, which shows how Carson's goods ultimately have outweighed the cons:</p>

      <tr>

        <td>Not in church</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Based on this data, scientist were able to convince the global scientific community that June, ultimately, made the right choice.
    </p>
    <p>But, truly, the proof is in the Pearl!</p>

    <h2 id="4">Parting notes and links</h2>
    <p>Shoot! I need to put a link in here and I didn't know where else to squeeze it in.</p>
    <p>Pearl's parents work in order to provide her with food, fun, and friends (at childcare).</p>
    <p>Pearl's mom, June, works at BAM, where you can currently see the work of <a href="http://www.boiseartmuseum.org/exhibition/jo-hamilton-knots-in-time/" target="_blank">Jo Hamilton</a>. It's crochet-xelent!</p>
    <p>Pearl's father works for St. Luke's, but would like to become a programmer. One of his next learning goals is to learn how to develop a game. He will peruse the tutorials at 
  <a href="https://phaser.io/" target="_blank">Phaser</a>, so he can start working on a simple game<hr /><a href="#top">Go to top</a></p>
